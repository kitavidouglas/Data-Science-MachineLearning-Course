FindingsThe issue of old and potentially damaged tins identified in the previous audit continues to cause production damages and is now affecting the quality of bread as seen in increased returns.","Both market and production-related damages are leading to financial losses, with the total cost implication amounting to approximately 149,135.88 (combining the production and market-related damages).The production damages are closely linked to the quality of the materials used (e.g., damaged tins). There is a need to ensure that the production process adheres strictly to quality standards, especially regarding packaging materials. If left unaddressed, this issue could cause further deterioration in product quality and increase the number of returns, affecting customer satisfaction and long-term brand loyalty.Exceeding the allowed thresholds for both production and market-related damages might expose the company to risks of non-compliance with internal policies",149135.88,,,"·       We recommend the branch to strengthen damages controls to ensure that production and market damages remain within the acceptable thresholds of 0.2% and 0.5% respectively.·       We also recommend an immediate action which is needed to replace or repair the damaged tins to prevent further impact on product quality.·       The branch should work closely with supermarkets to ensure that bread orders are in line with actual sales potential.·       Additionally, a more stringent return policy should be implemented, potentially involving shared costs or limiting the quantity of bread orders, to minimize returns due to over ordering.",N/A,N/A,N/A

Average Yield per Bag
200.16","·       Production target was below the set target, and this indicated that the branch’s production capacity was underutilized by 19.82% which could imply lost sales.The yield per bag is 200.16 pieces of bread, slightly below the expected 201 pieces per bag. While this is a small deviation, it may indicate room for improvement in production efficiency, which could potentially lead to an increase in the overall output without additional resource consumption.",None,,,·       The branch should work towards achieving the set production target and Yield.,N/A,N/A,N/A

61","·       The slicing efficiency target of 97 crates per slicer was not achieved due to lower production at the branch, which resulted from reduced order volumes.Hiring 61 extra slicers cost the company KES 55, 632 in additional labour costs. The 87% efficiency achieved is still below the ideal packing target, which suggests the company did not fully optimize the use of the extra slicers hired.",55632.0,,,The branch together with the sales team should ensure enough sales orders are secured to support optimal production levels.,N/A,N/A,N/A
